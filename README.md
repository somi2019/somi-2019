## WorldCupMatches

For this mini project I worked on world cup matches dataset, which includes matches during **1930 to 2014** held in different cities between different teams I focouced on some of variables mainly like *Home team goals*, *away team goals*, *audience* and some other variable to be used was created for this report such as *total goals*. Here I put some main Visualization of my project in this file:

* Total Goals Distrubution:

Distribution of *Total Goals* using the *hist()* function. We can see in the graphs that the data is skewed to the right.

*	Attendance in Home Town:

Attendance in cities like *London* and *Mexico City* and *Los Angeles* were more than other cities for, to be more specific I filtered number of  audiences  between *70,000 to 150,000* and used the function of *facet_wrap* to separate cities.

*	Attendance VS. Home Team Games (More than *50000* attendance):

Another format for checking games with high number of audiences for hometown games filled with total goals, *Brazil and Mexico* had most audiences in home town matches.

*	Attendance of Winning Teams with the Location of Game: 

This plot shows relationship of attendance vs winning teams and the location of matches, colored disceretly,also in *Netherland* match there were fewest attendance to watch the game.

*	Attendance vs. Date: Plot shows relation of attendance versus the year the match was held, it is also colored by winning team, using the *scale_colour_iwanthue()* function and *palette of hues* which has lots of colors for qualitative variable. *Italy* in *1970* has the most audiences more than *100,000* people.

*	Away team goals vs. Home team goals in USA: 

To check one country situations specifically *USA* home team goals vs. away team goals was considered, there were 5 away team goals for *Czechoslovakia* and 1 home team goals for *USA*, also 3 goals for *USA* and 0 for *Paraguay*, this way we can check every country more specifically. For writing on the plot, used annotate function and *geom_label_repel* to have rectangle labels.

*	Total goals in *USA* matches over the years:

To continue focusing on one specific country, using *geom_point* it can be seen than during the year’s total goals of a match to be more obvious I used *facet wrap function* to show the away team player. For instance, in play with *Czechoslovakia* there were total of *6* goals in *1990*.

## Conclusion:

•	According to histograms of Attendance and Total Goals as we see skewness in first plot, so if we want to have more specicific result, it is better to normalize them at first then work on data.

•	For audiences between 70,000 to 150,000 Number of attendance in cities like **London** and **Mexico City** and **Los Angeles** were the most in home town matches.

•	For More than **50,000** attendance Teams of **Brazil** and **Mexico** had most audiences in home town matches.

•	For audiences more than **90,000** for games with 2 goals there were the most attendances in **Rio De Janiro**.Also in **Netherland** match there were fewest attendance to watch the game.

•	**Italy** in **1970** has the most audiences more than 100,000 people.

•	specifically for **USA** home team goals vs. away team goals was considered, there were 5 away team goals for **Czechoslovakia** and 1 home team goals for a **USA**, also 3 goals for **USA** and 0 for **Paraguay**.
